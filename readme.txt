BuddyBot integrates directly with OpenAI Assistants API, enabling a seamless connection between your WordPress site and OpenAI’s AI models. It communicates via API requests, sending user inputs to OpenAI’s cloud-based assistant, which processes the data and returns a relevant response in real time. The plugin manages API authentication using your OpenAI API key, ensuring secure and efficient communication. BuddyBot also supports vector-based AI training, where site content (posts, pages, and comments) is preprocessed and synchronized to OpenAI’s vector store, allowing the assistant to retrieve context-aware responses. With built-in WordPress hooks and AJAX handling, BuddyBot provides a smooth, asynchronous chatbot experience without slowing down your site.
