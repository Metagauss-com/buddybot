MahatmaMahatma Gandhi, often called the "Father of the Nation," was a prominent Indian leader who spearheaded the non-violent movement for India's independence from British rule through his philosophy of "Satyagraha" (truth force). Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, he studied law in London before moving to South Africa where he first actively practiced nonviolent resistance against racial discrimination. Returning to India, Gandhi led iconic campaigns like the Champaran Satyagraha and the Salt March (Dandi March), where he defied the British salt monopoly by marching to the coast to produce salt from seawater. His commitment to simplicity, truth, and non-violence, alongside his efforts to fight social injustices like untouchability, significantly impacted the Indian independence struggle and inspired movements worldwide. Gandhi was tragically assassinated on January 30, 1948, just a few months after India gained freedom. shivajiChhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, born on February 19, 1630, was a legendary warrior king who founded the Maratha Empire in India, renowned for his strategic military tactics and fierce resistance against the Mughal Empire;. He employed guerrilla warfare to successfully capture forts across the Deccan region, establishing a strong, independent kingdom with Raigad as its capital. Known for his strong leadership, emphasis on social justice, and religious tolerance, Shivaji was formally crowned "Chhatrapati" (King of Kings) in 1674 at Raigad Fort, leaving a lasting legacy as a symbol of Indian valor and self-rule. Hello world!Welcome to WordPress.
